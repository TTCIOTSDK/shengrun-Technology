The keyless entry and start system, referred to as the PEPS system, uses advanced radio frequency technology to unlock the Automotive 
door and enter the vechile without the need to operate the car's remote control key. Under the existing technical conditions, PEPS 
has more intelligent access control management and higher anti-theft performance, and has gradually become the mainstream of automotive 
electronic anti-theft system applications. However, with the vigorous promotion and development of the new energy automobile industry in 
recent years, the Automotive networking process has been accelerating, and more and more IoT innovation technologies have been used in 
Vechiles, People are constantly proposing new conveniences for traveling. The demand not only realizes the interconnection and mapping 
between the Vechile and the mobile phone, but also the unlocking and starting of the car, and hopes to complete it with the mobile phone.
In addition, the driver's license and the driving license are electronically trended, and the car can be started by simply carrying the 
mobile phone.
